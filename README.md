# MyAnalogProcessor
Simulating an analog processor 
## Noise generated 
Analog computers generate noise over time, these are the assumtions made in this simulation
0.4% per transferre 
0.5% per 100ms (this simulation assumes the processor is 2.5MHz)
## What am I trying to simulate 
I'm trying to simulate the 'Gepanapa' (https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/p.dudek/projects/gepanapa/)
